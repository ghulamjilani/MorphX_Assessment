        body: |-
          <p>Dear %{user_name},</p>
          <p>We are worried that you may soon be without access to your business account. Your balance is past due. Please provide payment as soon as possible so your service won’t be cancelled.</p>
          <p>Your service will be limited beginning %{start_date} (check time zone) for the next %{suspended_days} days while we await your payment. While your account is in delinquent status you will not be able to create new sessions or upload new videos, and new channel subscriptions will not be possible. However, you are still able to stream currently existing sessions.</p>
          <p>Payments from %{platform_name} to your account will resume once your account is made current. Please ensure payment is processed prior to %{prior_to_date} to avoid deactivation of your account.</p>
