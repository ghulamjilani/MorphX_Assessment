Configuring Redis as a cache
If you plan to use Redis just as a cache where every key will have an
expire set, you may consider using the following configuration instead
(assuming a max memory limit of 2 megabytes as an example):
maxmemory 2mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
In this configuration there is no need for the application to set a time
to live for keys using the EXPIRE command (or equivalent) since all the
keys will be evicted using an approximated LRU algorithm as long as we
hit the 2 megabyte memory limit.
Basically in this configuration Redis acts in a similar way to
memcached.
